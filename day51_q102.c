//#include <stdio.h>

Write a Program to take a sorted array arr[] and an integer x as input, find the index (0-based) of the smallest element in arr[] that is greater than or equal to x and print it. This element is called the ceil of x. If such an element does not exist, print -1. Note: In case of multiple occurrences of ceil of x, return the index of the first occurrence.

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int n, x, arr[100];
    int ans = -1;

    scanf("%d", &n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        scanf("%d", &arr[i]);

    scanf("%d", &x);

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (arr[i] >= x) {
            ans = i;
            break;
        }
    }

    printf("%d", ans);
    return 0;
}
